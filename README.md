# Emofishes (Emotional Fishes)
## Introduction

Emofishes is a collection of proof of concepts that help improve, bypass or detect virtualized execution environments (focusing on the ones setup for malware analysis). Part of the code in all of the tools and the naming of the projects are based on [Alberto Ortega](https://github.com/a0rtega/pafish) Pafish (Paranoid Fish) project.

### Common

A static link library that contain common code to all the tools. This library should be built before any of the tools, as all of them depend on it.

### Cufish (Curious Fish)

The environments used to perform behavioural analysis of malware need to be stealth, being able to avoid detection by malware is a must because it will spare the researcher or incident responder precious time in the analysis of the incident. Cufish aims to help with that, providing information about the execution environment that could be used pre-emptively to improve the sandbox and avoid detection by malware. You can [download](https://github.com/serializingme/emofishes/raw/master/dist/cufish.exe) the compiled executable.

### Nofish (Nosey Fish)

Nosey Fish lists all directories and files of all the drives in a system. This as the objective of making it easier to inspect the file system contents of the environments used to perform behavioural analysis. You can [download](https://github.com/serializingme/emofishes/raw/master/dist/nofish.exe) the compiled executable.

### Exfish (Extrovert Fish)

Extrovert Fish exfiltrates over the network the FireEye MPS file system filter driver used to monitor activity inside the sandbox environment. The driver is sent in Base64 encoded chuncks over a UDP socket.

## Build it Yourself

All code is written in C and can be built with MinGW. To compile you will likely need to use:

```
(If compiling in Windows systems)
> make -f Makefile.win

(If cross-compiling in Linux systems for a 32 bits Windows)
$ make -f Makefile.linux-32

(If cross-compiling in Linux systems for a 64 bits Windows)
$ make -f Makefile.linux-64
```

## Licensing

All code is licensed under GNU/GPL version 3. Icons used have been created by [Fast Icon Design](http://fasticon.com/).
